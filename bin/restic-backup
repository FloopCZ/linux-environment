# Back up a folder via restic.

# For e.g. BackBlaze B2, initialize the following
# environmental varaibles:
#
# B2_ACCOUNT_ID="<APPLICATION_KEY_ID>"
# B2_ACCOUNT_KEY="<APPLICATION_KEY>"
# RESTIC_REPOSITORY="b2:<BUCKET_NAME>"
# RESTIC_PASSWORD="<RESTIC_PASSWORD>"
#
# Skip the RESTIC_PASSWORD variable in order to be
# asked for password interactively.
#
# A secure way to do that is to copy the previous lines
# to e.g., /etc/restic/b2.env and restrict its permissions.
# This file can be used in systemd units via `EnvironmentFile`
# directive or it can be used on command line as:
# env $(cat /etc/restic/b2.env | xargs) restic-backup
