# For e.g. BackBlaze B2, don't forget to set
# the following environmental varaibles:
#
# export B2_ACCOUNT_ID="<APPLICATION_KEY_ID>"
# export B2_ACCOUNT_KEY="<APPLICATION_KEY>"
# export RESTIC_REPOSITORY="b2:<BUCKET_NAME>"
# export RESTIC_PASSWORD="<RESTIC_PASSWORD>"
#
# A good place for those could be e.g., /etc/restic/b2_env.sh.
