# Back up a folder via restic.

# For e.g. BackBlaze B2, don't forget to set
# the following environmental varaibles:
#
# B2_ACCOUNT_ID="<APPLICATION_KEY_ID>"
# B2_ACCOUNT_KEY="<APPLICATION_KEY>"
# RESTIC_REPOSITORY="b2:<BUCKET_NAME>"
# RESTIC_PASSWORD="<RESTIC_PASSWORD>"
#
# One way to do that is to copy the previous lines
# to e.g., /etc/restic/b2.env. Such a file can be directly
# used in systemd unit or as:
# env $(cat /etc/restic/b2.env | xargs) restic-backup
